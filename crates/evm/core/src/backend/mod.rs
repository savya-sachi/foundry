/// Provides the underlying `revm::Database` implementation.
///
/// A `Backend` can be initialised in two forms:
///
/// # 1. Empty in-memory Database
/// This is the default variant: an empty `revm::Database`
///
/// # 2. Forked Database
/// A `revm::Database` that forks off a remote client
///
///
/// In addition to that we support forking manually on the fly.
/// Additional forks can be created. Each unique fork is identified by its unique `ForkId`. We treat
/// forks as unique if they have the same `(endpoint, block number)` pair.
///
/// When it comes to testing, it's intended that each contract will use its own `Backend`
/// (`Backend::clone`). This way each contract uses its own encapsulated evm state. For in-memory
/// testing, the database is just an owned `revm::InMemoryDB`.
///
/// Each `Fork`, identified by a unique id, uses completely separate storage, write operations are
/// performed only in the fork's own database, `ForkDB`.
///
/// A `ForkDB` consists of 2 halves:
///   - everything fetched from the remote is readonly
///   - all local changes (instructed by the contract) are written to the backend's `db` and don't
///     alter the state of the remote client.
///
/// # Fork swapping
///
/// Multiple "forks" can be created `Backend::create_fork()`, however only 1 can be used by the
/// `db`. However, their state can be hot-swapped by swapping the read half of `db` from one fork to
/// another.
/// When swapping forks (`Backend::select_fork()`) we also update the current `Env` of the `EVM`
/// accordingly, so that all `block.*` config values match
///
/// When another for is selected [`DatabaseExt::select_fork()`] the entire storage, including
/// `JournaledState` is swapped, but the storage of the caller's and the test contract account is
/// _always_ cloned. This way a fork has entirely separate storage but data can still be shared
/// across fork boundaries via stack and contract variables.
///
/// # Snapshotting
///
/// A snapshot of the current overall state can be taken at any point in time. A snapshot is
/// identified by a unique id that's returned when a snapshot is created. A snapshot can only be
/// reverted _once_. After a successful revert, the same snapshot id cannot be used again. Reverting
/// a snapshot replaces the current active state with the snapshot state, the snapshot is deleted
/// afterwards, as well as any snapshots taken after the reverted snapshot, (e.g.: reverting to id
/// 0x1 will delete snapshots with ids 0x1, 0x2, etc.)
///
/// **Note:** Snapshots work across fork-swaps, e.g. if fork `A` is currently active, then a
/// snapshot is created before fork `B` is selected, then fork `A` will be the active fork again
/// after reverting the snapshot.
